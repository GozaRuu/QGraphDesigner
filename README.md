# QGraphDesigner
Qt Widget that implements a GUI graph creator and finds the shortest path between any two vertices.
##Usage
This project is an actual widget so you can add it to your project like any other widget. To do that simply copy the contents of headers and source into your project and create a `QGraphDesigner` object in your code </br>
Also I included a sample project that uses this widget by itself for testing.

Here is a descriptive video in which I demonstrate a full user story:</br>
